# ⭐ AI-Powered Review Generator

The **Review Generator** is a simple web-based tool that uses AI to generate high-quality reviews based on answers submitted by the user in a form. It’s designed to help users quickly create well-written reviews they can post on platforms like **Google**, **Amazon**, **Yelp**, and more.

## 🧠 What It Does

Instead of typing a review from scratch, users just fill out a short form about:

- Their experience
- What product or service they used
- How satisfied they were

Then, the app uses an AI model (like OpenAI’s GPT) to generate a natural, human-like review that the user can copy and paste anywhere.
